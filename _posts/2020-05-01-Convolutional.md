Convolution Neural Network is one among various types of Deep Learning Neural Networks. CNN is very powerful and widely used in image classification, image recognition, computer vision etc.

# Convolution



In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) (in particular, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis)), **convolution** is a [mathematical operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)) on two [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) (*f* and *g*) that produces a third function f*g that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term *convolution* refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it. It is defined as the [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted. The integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function.

## Definition

The convolution of *f* and *g* is written *f*∗*g*, denoting the operator with the symbol ∗.[[B\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#cite_note-3) It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted.
