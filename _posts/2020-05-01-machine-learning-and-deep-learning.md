The term “artificial intelligence” has been around since the 1950s, but it’s taken more than half a century for it to finally have a transformative impact on everyday life.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is baked into much of the tech we use every day. The machine “learns” from past data and adjusts its responses instead of following precise “if this, do that” coding commands. It can also do things like predict whether a stock will rise or fall and estimate your current home price based on recent sales of similar homes.

### Deep Learning

Machine learning has several subsets, but deep learning is the one that gets all the sexy headlines. It’s the “brains” behind language processing, face and image recognition, and even things like hand gesture recognition.

While there’s more than one kind of deep learning, people usually use the phrase to refer to deep neural networks, deep refers to the number of layers in a neural network. There’s an input layer that takes in information, an output layer that gives the response, and “hidden” layers where the learning takes place.
